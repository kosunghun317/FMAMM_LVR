# Notes on the LVR of FM-AMM
This is auxiliary repo for [post](https://ethresear.ch/t/notes-on-the-lvr-of-fm-amm/20151) on *Loss-Versus-Rebalancing* (LVR) of *Function Maximizing Automated Market Maker* (FM-AMM).

For the derivation of batch clearing logic and LVR, see ```notebooks/FMAMM_batch_math.ipynb``` and ```notebooks/LVR_derivation.ipynb```, respectively.

For the simulations and comparison against CPMM, refer the rest.
